// Week 10: Frontend â€“ AI Recommendation UX (Logic Only)

// --- Task 1: Visualize Buy/Sell/Hold recommendations ---

// Sample recommendation data
const recommendations = [
  { stock: "AAPL", action: "Buy" },
  { stock: "TSLA", action: "Hold" },
  { stock: "NVDA", action: "Sell" }
];

// Mapping each action to a color
const actionColor = {
  Buy: "green",
  Hold: "gray",
  Sell: "red"
};

// Display each recommendation with corresponding color (logic only)
recommendations.forEach(rec => {
  console.log(`${rec.stock}: ${rec.action} [Color: ${actionColor[rec.action]}]`);
});


// --- Task 2: Add explanation panel for each recommendation ---

// Each recommendation now includes an explanation from the AI model
const recommendationsWithExplanation = [
  {
    stock: "AAPL",
    action: "Buy",
    explanation: "Strong earnings and positive growth outlook."
  },
  {
    stock: "TSLA",
    action: "Hold",
    explanation: "Valuation is high; wait for better entry point."
  },
  {
    stock: "NVDA",
    action: "Sell",
    explanation: "Short-term correction expected after recent rally."
  }
];

// Display each recommendation with explanation (logic only)
recommendationsWithExplanation.forEach(rec => {
  console.log(`\n${rec.stock}: ${rec.action}`);
  console.log(`Explanation: ${rec.explanation}`);
});


// --- Task 3 (Optional): Add news sentiment timeline ---

// Timeline data with news sentiment over time
const newsSentimentTimeline = [
  { date: "2025-08-01", sentiment: "positive" },
  { date: "2025-08-02", sentiment: "neutral" },
  { date: "2025-08-03", sentiment: "negative" }
];

// Color mapping for sentiment
const sentimentColor = {
  positive: "green",
  neutral: "gray",
  negative: "red"
};

// Display sentiment timeline (logic only)
console.log("\nNews Sentiment Timeline:");
newsSentimentTimeline.forEach(entry => {
  console.log(`${entry.date}: ${entry.sentiment} [Color: ${sentimentColor[entry.sentiment]}]`);
});


// --- Milestone: Full recommendation workflow logic complete ---
